/**
 * Example of a repository implementation using MongoDB.
 *
 * **Note: Example here tries to introduces strictness. Actual code may slightly lower
 * rigority when necessary.**
 *
 * ### Constructor
 *
 * MongoDB operations work through `MongoCollection`, therefore the initialization
 * of this repository would depend on `MongoClient` or `MongoDatabase`.
 *
 * ### Exception Handling in Operations
 *
 * Typically, operation is wrapped with [runMongoCatching], allowing
 * any errors to be caught and wrapped into the `Result` type.
 *
 * Typically, the result of update, replace, and delete operations are
 * checked to ensure a modification was done. Helper such as [throwIfNothingModified]
 * can be used easily check the result and throw an error.
 *
 * ### Exception Logging
 *
 * No logging should be done in the repository layer, though repository
 * may attach context by passing a string message into `runMongoCatching`.
 *
 * Error that happens in the repository layer is usually Mongo's internal
 * or when the document doesn't exist (which already have a default error message).
 * This makes custom message rarely used.
 *
 * Error would be propagated to the subunit layer where detailed domain
 * logging should be done. This makes error shows up like:
 * - Suppose that the `items` for playerABC does not exist.
 * - By using `runMongoCatching`, getting a `null` data will throw [DocumentNotFoundException]
 *   which has a default message of "Expected document not exist".
 * - The exception will be wrapped in a [Result.failure].
 * - The result is passed to the subunit layer.
 * - Subunit checks whether the result fails and handles accordingly.
 * - It may log something like "Items not found for playerABC".
 *
 * This results in clear separation and no duplicate error logging.

/**
 * Example of a subunit scoped to a player that carries [PlayerRepository].
 * Acts as a domain-level abstraction for higher-level components such as message handlers.
 *
 * **Note: Example here tries to introduces strictness. Actual code may slightly lower
 * rigority when necessary.**
 *
 * ### Local Data & Initialization
 *
 * Data is cached locally to reduce repeated queries to the repository.
 * Update operations modify both the local cache and the repository.
 *
 * All fields are initially `null` or empty collections and are populated in [debut].
 * Initialization failures are logged immediately but do not interrupt the subunit
 * or the player's connection (fail-late).
 *
 * Accessing data that failed to initialize or is missing will fail fast at the usage site.
 * Depending on the context, handlers may require these values to be present or handle
 * their absence gently.
 *
 * Example: [items] is essential for the session. If it fails to load during initialization,
 * the error is logged, but the player's session continues. When [items] is later required,
 * the handler may fail the operation (e.g., by throwing [error] inside the `get` methods
 * or via a `requireNotNull`-style check in handler).
 * In cases where the value is optional, the handler may instead provide a fallback.
 *
 * ### Subunit API
 *
 * The subunit exposes domain-oriented APIs derived from repository operations.
 * These APIs may extend or refine repository data into more meaningful abstractions.
 *
 * Example: the repository provides `getInventory()`, while the subunit may expose
 * higher-level queries such as `getEquipment()` or `getFood()` by filtering the data.
 *
 * ### Return Types
 *
 * In a strict handling requirement, subunit's operations may:
 * - Use [encore.utils.types.Report] type for operations that returns `Unit`.
 * - Use [encore.utils.types.Outcome] type for operations that returns a value.
 *
 * Since initialization is fail-late and fields may remain null, all `get` operations
 * are made to return non-null value by throwing [error]; unless when null values are acceptable.
 *
 * ### Logging
 *
 * The subunit is responsible for logging operations in domain language, avoiding
 * DB/repository details.
 *
 * This includes logging any errors on [Result] type obtained from the repository.
 * Typically, the result is chained with [onSuccess] and [onFailure]
 * for logging handler, then converting with [toReport] or [toOutcome] for the return value.
 * Inside `onFailure`, the throwable can call helpers like [failHandleGet] and [failHandleUpdate].
 * Both fail handle helpers has a default message that can be used to avoid writing logging
 * boilerplate, in the case where context is clear enough.
 *
 * It should also avoid logging request context as it is handler's responsibility.
 *
 * For instance:
 * - Repository do not log, but may provide message in exception such as "Document not found"
 * - Subunit logs domain, such as "Couldn't calculate resource with invalid timer object"
 * - Handler logs request context and orchestration, such as
 *   "Failed to collect resource from building=buildingName on calculateResource"
 *
 * ### Handler Example
 *
 * ```
 * // request remain unhandled
 * val items = playerSubunit.getItems().ifEmptyNull ?: return
 *
 * // runtime error thrown by subunit
 * val health = playerSubunit.getHealth()
 *
 * // alternatively, subunit returns nullable value and handler throws
 * val health = requireNotNull(playerSubunit.getHealth()) { "Health is null" }
 *
 * // handling of outcome
 * val health = playerSubunit.getHealth()
 * val response: Response = subunit.getItems().fold(
 *     onOk = { newHp -> ResponseSuccess("HP reduced now: $newHp") },
 *     onFail = {
 *         Fancam.trace { "Failed to reduce HP by $reduceBy, currentHp=$health" }
 *         ResponseFailed("Failed to reduce HP")
 *     }
 * )
 * connection.send(response)
 * ```
