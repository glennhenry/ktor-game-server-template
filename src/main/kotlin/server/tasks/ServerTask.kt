/**
 * Represents a server-side task with a well-defined lifecycle.
 *
 * A task defines its timing, repetition, and behavior through [TaskConfig].
 * Each implementation should contain only the logic specific to that task type.
 *
 * Typically, tasks implement this interface as a reusable template,
 * allowing callers to run them easily without dealing with lower-level scheduling logic.
 *
 * [ServerTask] implementation should be able to provide `stopId`, a reproducible, deterministic identifier for the task.
 * The derived ID is used for referencing and cancelling tasks consistently across server components.
 * Typically it is derived from a combination of the player ID, [name], and [StopInput] instance (e.g., a `buildingId`).
 *
 * Example
 * ```
 * context.taskDispatcher.registerTask(
 *     code = "DT",
 *     stopInputFactory = { StopParameter() },
 *     deriveTaskId = { playerId, name, _ ->
 *         // "DT-playerId123"
 *         "${name.code}-$playerId"
 *     }
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * ### Lifecycle Overview
 * A task may run once or repeatedly, depending on its configuration.
 *
 * **Non-repeatable task:**
 * ```
 * task.start()
 * ├─ onStart()
 * ├─ ...delay(startDelay) [optional]
 * ├─ execute()
 * └─ onTaskComplete() / onCancelled()
 * ```
 *
 * **Repeatable task:**
 * ```
 * task.start()
 * ├─ onStart()
 * ├─ ...delay(startDelay) [optional]
 * ├─ repeat until cancelled, timeout, or maxRepeats reached:
 * │   ├─ onIterationStart()
 * │   ├─ execute()
 * │   ├─ onIterationComplete()
 * │   └─ ...delay(repeatInterval) [optional]
 * └─ onTaskComplete() / onCancelled()
 * ```
 *
 * Only [execute] must be implemented; all other lifecycle hooks are optional.
 * Each lifecycle callback receives a [Connection] instance, representing the player's connection this task belongs to.
 *
 * @property name      Identifier for this task, this may be a short code.
 * @property config    Defines timing, delay, and repetition rules for task execution.
 * @property scheduler Optional scheduler for this task.
 *                     Typically, when scheduling is complex, the [ServerTask] itself implements it.
 *
 * @param TaskInput The type of data required to execute this task.
 * @param StopInput The type of data used to identify and stop this task.
 *
 * @property inputBlock DSL block to produce [TaskInput] instance, to produce data needed to execute the task. **Make sure to set every variables here.**
 * @property stopBlock DSL block to produce [StopInput] instance, to produce data needed to cancel the task. **Make sure to set every variables here.**
 * @property createInput Applies the [inputBlock] block to an empty [TaskInput].
 * @property stopBlock Applies the [stopBlock] block to an empty [StopInput].
